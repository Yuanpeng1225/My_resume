## About Me

Hi! I’m Yuanpeng Yang, a current M.S. in Business Analytics student at Brandeis University with a background in financial engineering and business management. I became deeply interested in data analytics during my graduate studies and professional experience, where I saw firsthand how data-driven insights can significantly improve business decision-making.

In my previous role at ZTE Corporation, I led performance visualization projects and helped streamline reporting processes through BI tools. Watching leadership rely on real-time dashboards to guide strategy made me realize how powerful analytics can be when it is translated into clarity and action. What excites me about this field is not just working with data, but bridging the gap between **raw information** and **business impact**.

I particularly enjoy creating visualizations, building predictive models, and designing analytical workflows that help organizations operate smarter. Data analytics allows me to combine logical thinking with creativity — uncovering patterns, solving problems, and supporting stronger decisions through evidence.

**Areas of Interest**  
- Data Analytics & Business Intelligence  
- Data Visualization and Dashboard Development  
- Predictive / Statistical Modeling  
- Data-Driven Decision-Making in Real Business Contexts

**Tools**  
Python · SQL · Tableau · Power BI · Excel · R

I’m continuously learning, building projects, and exploring how analytics can transform business performance in a meaningful way.
